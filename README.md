# ServerBrandChanger

A fabric mod that changes your Minecraft server's brand which shows up in the Minecraft client F3 menu.

## How to use

Download the latest release and place it in the mods folder. After you start the server at least once with the mod installed, a folder named "serverbrandchanger" will be created in your mods folder. You can then edit the brand.txt file inside of the folder with a server brand of your choice.

## Building
